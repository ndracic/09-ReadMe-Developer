## Description
In order to increase the likelihood that other developers will use and contribute to the project's success, a high-quality README should be included when creating an open source project on GitHub. This information should include information about the app, including what it is used for, how to use it, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. A command-line tool will make it simple and quick to create a project README so you can get started right away. This will free up the project developer to work on finishing the project rather than spending time writing a solid README.
